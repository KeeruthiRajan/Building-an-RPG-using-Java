## Player Concept
- A $${\color{pink} pink}$$ slime (easy to design, for a first game)
- Wears a hard hat and roams through the environment

## Future Plans
- Add a different transformation (sprite) based on collectible items, inspired by $${\color{pink} Kirby}$$.
- Create different movement sprites based on forms
