## Tilemap Concept
- The tile map is a gem mine, with ores and walls as tiles
- 5 different kinds of ores, scattered based on rarity
- Ore rarity increases from 1 - 5 (**$${\color{gray} Coal}$$** -> **$${\color{silver} Platinum}$$**)
- **$${\color{cyan} Water}$$** block added to test collision and add some depth in the world
- **$${\color{brown} Wall}$$** block, simply for the borders of map

## Dimensions of Sprites
- Original Size: **16 x 16**
- In Game: Scaled thrice, ie., **48 x 48**

## Future Plans
- Incorporate interaction with tilemap, like breaking ores
- Collecting ores can result in change in form, as mentioned in player description
- Adding more depth and color to the mines with different colored moss and oil
