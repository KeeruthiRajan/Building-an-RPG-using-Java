# Building-an-RPG-using-Java
This Repository logs my journey in building an RPG using Java.

## Reference Resources / Inspirations
Concepts and Tutorials by [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq&pp=0gcJCbAEOCosWNin) on YouTube.  
RPG loosely inspired by $${\color{red} 1986 Zelda}$$ and $${\color{purple} Undertale.}$$  

## Current Status:
- Gamepanel has been created
- Entity Class has been incorporated
- Keyboard Input has been sorted out
- Player Class and Sprites have been added
- Tiles created and Tilemap has been drawn
- A dynamic viewport system included
- Collision enabled for certain tiles

## How to Run:
- Install an IDE that can run Java (preferrably $${\color{blue} Eclipse}$$)
- Download the game folder from GitHub
- Open in IDE and locate main.java
- Run main.java
- To test and debug other features, run class files seperately.
